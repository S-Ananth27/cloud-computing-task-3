# DISCRIPTION OF THE TASK

The objective of this task is to design, implement, and demonstrate a multi-cloud architecture that spans across two leading cloud platforms: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). This architecture must not only distribute services across both providers but also ensure interoperability, resilience, and seamless communication between components hosted on each cloud. The primary purpose is to showcase how real-world applications can be developed in a cloud-agnostic manner, thereby avoiding vendor lock-in, improving fault tolerance, and optimizing performance through service specialization. In this scenario, the system will include various integrated services, such as static website hosting, RESTful backend APIs, file storage, messaging queues, authentication, and database services, with select services deliberately placed on different platforms based on their strengths and intended roles.
